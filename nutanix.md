**Q1.** A customer reports their Nutanix cluster is down and is frustrated. How do you respond?
üëâ Stay calm, acknowledge urgency, reassure them, gather logs, escalate if needed.

**Q2.** How would you explain ‚Äúhyperconverged infrastructure‚Äù to a non-technical customer?

üëâ Collaborate, listen, justify with facts, align on customer-first resolution.

**Q4.** Customer says: ‚ÄúWe already tried your solution and it didn‚Äôt work.‚Äù What‚Äôs your next step?
üëâ Ask clarifying questions, review logs, double-check steps, escalate if reproducible.

**Q5.** Customer asks something you don‚Äôt know. Do you guess?
üëâ Admit you don‚Äôt know but will check with engineering and get back quickly.

**Q6.** If multiple customers face high-priority issues at once, how do you prioritize?
üëâ Follow severity/impact guidelines (production outage > minor bug).

**Q7.** A customer keeps interrupting while you‚Äôre troubleshooting. How do you handle it?
üëâ Politely acknowledge, assure progress updates, then continue systematic troubleshooting.

**Q8.** How would you calm an angry customer?
üëâ Stay professional, empathize, avoid blame, show urgency to solve.

**Q9.** Your fix solves the issue temporarily but not permanently. Do you stop there?
üëâ No ‚Äî document RCA, suggest permanent fix, open bug report if needed.

**Q10.** What does ‚Äúcustomer-first‚Äù mean to you?
üëâ Ensuring the customer‚Äôs business impact is minimized, not just solving the technical issue.

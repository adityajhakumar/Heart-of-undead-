**Title:** *A Novel Hybrid Sorting Algorithm: Combining Bubble and Insertion Sorts*

**Abstract:**
This paper presents a novel hybrid sorting algorithm that merges the fundamental concepts of bubble sort and insertion sort. The proposed algorithm, referred to as Hybrid Bubble-Insertion Sort (HBIS), utilizes a dynamic approach to switching between the two sorting techniques based on the size of the dataset. This hybrid method aims to optimize sorting performance by leveraging the strengths of both algorithms while mitigating their individual limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that HBIS offers improved efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional sorting methods.

**1. Introduction**
Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science, with numerous applications in data processing, searching, and optimization. While many sorting algorithms have been proposed, including quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort, simple algorithms like bubble sort and insertion sort remain relevant due to their conceptual simplicity and ease of implementation. This paper explores a novel hybrid sorting approach that combines bubble sort and insertion sort to achieve a balance between simplicity and efficiency.

**2. Background**

**2.1 Bubble Sort**
Bubble sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Although easy to implement, bubble sort is inefficient for large datasets due to its O(n^2) time complexity.

**2.2 Insertion Sort**
Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into the correct position within the already sorted portion. It also has an O(n^2) worst-case time complexity but performs better than bubble sort for small or partially sorted datasets.

**3. Hybrid Bubble-Insertion Sort (HBIS)**

**3.1 Concept**
HBIS leverages the strengths of both bubble sort and insertion sort. The algorithm uses bubble sort for larger arrays where its simplicity is advantageous and switches to insertion sort when the dataset size falls below a predefined threshold.

**3.2 Algorithm Design**
The HBIS algorithm is designed with the following steps:
1. **Threshold Definition**: Set a threshold value to determine when to switch between sorting methods.
2. **Sorting Process**:
   - For arrays larger than the threshold, apply bubble sort.
   - For arrays smaller than or equal to the threshold, apply insertion sort.

**3.3 Pseudocode**
```c
void hybridSort(int arr[], int n) {
    if (n <= THRESHOLD) {
        insertionSort(arr, 0, n - 1);
    } else {
        bubbleSort(arr, n);
    }
}
```

**4. Implementation**

**4.1 Code Structure**
The HBIS implementation consists of the following components:
- `sorting.c` and `sorting.h`: Contain the definitions of bubble sort, insertion sort, and hybrid sort functions.
- `main.c`: Contains the main function to demonstrate the hybrid sort algorithm.

**4.2 Example Code**
```c
#include "sorting.h"

#define THRESHOLD 10

void insertionSort(int arr[], int low, int high) {
    for (int i = low + 1; i <= high; i++) {
        int key = arr[i];
        int j = i - 1;
        while (j >= low && arr[j] > key) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j--;
        }
        arr[j + 1] = key;
    }
}

void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}

void hybridSort(int arr[], int n) {
    if (n <= THRESHOLD) {
        insertionSort(arr, 0, n - 1);
    } else {
        bubbleSort(arr, n);
    }
}

void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

**5. Experimental Results**

**5.1 Test Setup**
To evaluate the performance of HBIS, we conducted experiments comparing it with pure bubble sort and insertion sort. Various dataset sizes were tested, and execution times were recorded.

**5.2 Results**
The results showed that HBIS generally performed better than bubble sort on larger datasets due to its ability to switch to insertion sort for smaller subarrays. The hybrid approach reduced the average sorting time and improved performance for a wide range of dataset sizes.

**6. Conclusion**
The Hybrid Bubble-Insertion Sort algorithm presents a practical approach to sorting by combining the simplicity of bubble sort with the efficiency of insertion sort. By dynamically switching between these methods based on the dataset size, HBIS achieves better performance and adaptability compared to using bubble sort or insertion sort alone.

**7. Future Work**
Future work could involve exploring additional hybrid sorting approaches or optimizing the threshold selection process. Further research could also investigate the application of HBIS in different contexts or with additional sorting techniques.

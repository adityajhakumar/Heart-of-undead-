   - **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Users can recover their databases to a specific point in time, which helps in minimizing data loss during unforeseen events.
   - **Auto-Scaling**: With RDS, you can easily scale the compute and storage resources up or down according to the application's demand, ensuring optimal performance without manual scaling.

### Q2: Describe a scenario where you must set up a secure and scalable web application using AWS VPC. Explain the steps you would take to configure the VPC, including subnets, route tables, security groups, and any other relevant components. Discuss how you would ensure high availability and security for the application.

**Scenario**: You are tasked with setting up a secure and scalable web application for an online retail business. The application needs to handle large amounts of traffic, support dynamic content, and ensure that customer data is securely stored and transmitted.

**Steps to Configure the AWS VPC**:

1. **Create a VPC**:
   - Start by creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a CIDR block that accommodates the required IP addresses (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

2. **Subnets**:
   - **Public Subnets**: Create public subnets in multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to host the web servers. Public subnets will have access to the internet via an Internet Gateway.
   - **Private Subnets**: Create private subnets in multiple AZs for the application servers and database. These subnets do not have direct internet access but can access the internet via a NAT Gateway.

3. **Route Tables**:
   - **Public Route Table**: Associate the public subnets with a route table that directs internet-bound traffic to the Internet Gateway.
   - **Private Route Table**: Associate the private subnets with a route table that directs internet-bound traffic to a NAT Gateway in the public subnet.

4. **Security Groups**:
   - **Web Server Security Group**: Allow inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic (ports 80 and 443) from the internet and restrict other access.
   - **Application Server Security Group**: Allow inbound traffic only from the web server's security group on the necessary ports (e.g., port 8080 for web application traffic).
   - **Database Security Group**: Restrict inbound traffic to only the application server security group on the database port (e.g., port 3306 for MySQL).

5. **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)**:
   - Implement NACLs to provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level, defining allow/deny rules for incoming and outgoing traffic.

6. **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**:
   - Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of the web servers to distribute incoming traffic evenly across instances in different AZs, ensuring high availability.

7. **Auto Scaling**:
   - Configure Auto Scaling Groups for the web and application servers to automatically scale in/out based on demand, ensuring the application can handle traffic spikes.

8. **High Availability**:
   - Use multiple AZs for redundancy. If one AZ goes down, traffic can be routed to servers in the other AZs.
   - Store the database in a Multi-AZ RDS deployment for failover support.

9. **Security Measures**:
   - Enable **SSL/TLS** for encrypting data in transit between clients and the web servers.
   - Use **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** to encrypt sensitive data at rest.
   - Implement **AWS WAF** (Web Application Firewall) to protect the web application from common web exploits.

### Q3: Designing an e-commerce platform like Flipkart using AWS services involves leveraging various AWS tools to ensure scalability, reliability, and security.

**Designing an E-commerce Platform on AWS**:

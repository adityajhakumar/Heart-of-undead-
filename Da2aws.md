AWS Cloud Solutions for Smart Systems

Problem Statements

1. Smart Healthcare

The healthcare industry is increasingly relying on real-time patient data to make critical decisions. A cloud-based system is needed to collect data from wearable devices and medical equipment, allowing healthcare providers to monitor patients remotely. This solution must include real-time alerts for emergencies and predictive analysis to detect health anomalies.

2. Smart Agriculture

Agriculture is shifting toward precision farming, where data from sensors can help optimize water usage, crop growth, and resource management. A cloud-based system should ingest data from sensors deployed across farms and provide real-time insights and predictions to enhance crop yields while reducing waste.

3. Industry 4.0

With the rise of industrial automation, factories need cloud solutions to collect and process machinery data. These systems should predict equipment failures and optimize production, ensuring smooth operations and minimal downtime.

4. Smart Cities

Cities are becoming more connected through sensors that monitor traffic, public safety, and environmental factors. A cloud-based solution is required to process this data in real-time, allowing city officials to improve urban management through data-driven decisions.

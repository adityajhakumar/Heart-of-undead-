# Python — Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** What are Python’s key features compared to other languages?
   **A:** Python is high-level, interpreted, dynamically typed, and emphasizes readability (indentation). It has a large standard library (“batteries included”), first-class functions, built-in data structures (list/dict/set/tuple), and supports multiple paradigms (procedural, OOP, functional). Tradeoffs: faster development and readability vs lower raw CPU performance than compiled languages — mitigated with C extensions, NumPy, or PyPy.

2. **Q:** Explain Python’s memory management (reference counting, garbage collector).
   **A:** CPython primarily uses reference counting: each object tracks how many references point to it; when count reaches 0 it's freed immediately. To handle reference cycles, CPython has a cyclic generational garbage collector (`gc` module) that periodically finds unreachable cycles. `del` decrements refcount; `gc` can be inspected/triggered for debugging. Note: implementations differ (PyPy uses a different GC).

3. **Q:** What is the difference between `shallow copy` and `deepcopy`?
   **A:** A shallow copy (`copy.copy()`) copies the outer container but not nested mutable objects (they are referenced). A deep copy (`copy.deepcopy()`) recursively copies nested objects, producing independent structures. Example:

   ```py
   import copy
   a = [[1], [2]]
   b = copy.copy(a)       # b[0] is a[0]
   c = copy.deepcopy(a)   # c is fully independent
   ```

4. **Q:** What are Python decorators? Provide a use case.
   **A:** Decorators are callables that wrap functions/classes to modify behavior. Syntax `@decorator` above a function is sugar for `f = decorator(f)`. Use cases: logging, timing, access control, memoization. Example:

   ```py
   def timer(fn):
       import time
       def wrapper(*a, **kw):
           t0 = time.time()
           r = fn(*a, **kw)
           print('time:', time.time()-t0)
           return r
       return wrapper

   @timer
   def work(): ...
   ```

5. **Q:** How do iterators and generators differ?
   **A:** An *iterator* is any object implementing `__iter__()` and `__next__()`; you can iterate until `StopIteration`. A *generator* is a specific iterator created by a function using `yield`; it produces values lazily and maintains local state automatically. Generators are memory-efficient for streams/large data.

6. **Q:** Explain Python’s GIL (Global Interpreter Lock). Why is it a limitation?
   **A:** The GIL is a mutex in CPython that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time—simplifying memory management (reference counting). Limitation: CPU-bound multi-threaded programs won’t run in parallel on multiple cores. Solutions: use `multiprocessing`, native extensions that release the GIL (I/O or CPU in C), or alternatives like PyPy/Jython/stackless for different tradeoffs.

7. **Q:** What is monkey patching?
   **A:** Monkey patching is modifying/adding attributes (methods, functions) at runtime—e.g., changing a library class behavior for tests or quick fixes. It’s powerful but risky: can cause hard-to-trace bugs and break assumptions/compatibility. Use sparingly and document.

8. **Q:** Difference between `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and instance methods?
   **A:** Instance method: `def m(self,...)` — operates on an instance. `@classmethod`: `def m(cls,...)` — receives class object, useful for alternative constructors or class-level behavior. `@staticmethod`: `def m(...)` — no automatic `self`/`cls`; just a namespaced function. Example:

   ```py
   class C:
       def inst(self): ...
       @classmethod
       def cm(cls): ...
       @staticmethod
       def sm(): ...
   ```

9. **Q:** How does Python handle multithreading vs multiprocessing?
   **A:** Threads (`threading`) share memory but are limited by the GIL for CPU-bound tasks; good for I/O concurrency. `multiprocessing` spawns separate processes with independent memory (bypasses GIL) — better for CPU-bound work but has IPC/serialization overhead. High-level APIs: `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ProcessPoolExecutor`.

10. **Q:** Difference between `is` and `==`?
    **A:** `is` checks object identity (same memory object). `==` checks value equality by calling `__eq__`. Example: small integers and interned strings may be `is` identical due to caching, but don’t rely on it:

    ```py
    a = 1000; b = 1000
    a == b  # True
    a is b  # Often False
    ```

11. **Q:** What are Python’s core data structures and which is faster for lookups?
    **A:** `list` (ordered, mutable), `tuple` (ordered, immutable), `set` (unordered, unique elements), `dict` (key→value mapping). `set` and `dict` provide average O(1) membership/lookup due to hashing. `list`/`tuple` membership is O(n).

12. **Q:** How does exception handling work in Python?
    **A:** Use `try/except` to catch exceptions, `else` for code when no exception occurs, and `finally` for cleanup that always runs. Catch specific exceptions (not bare `except:`) and prefer re-raising (`raise`) when you can’t handle it. Example:

    ```py
    try:
        do()
    except ValueError as e:
        handle(e)
    else:
        success()
    finally:
        cleanup()
    ```

13. **Q:** How does Python’s dynamic typing affect performance?
    **A:** Dynamic typing adds runtime overhead for type checks and dynamic dispatch, causing slower execution than statically typed compiled languages. Mitigations: use optimized libraries (NumPy), C extensions, Cython, PyPy, static type checkers (`mypy`) for developer ergonomics (not runtime speed).

14. **Q:** What memory optimization techniques exist in Python (`interning`, `__slots__`, etc.)?
    **A:** Techniques include: string/interned small object caching (automatic for some values), `__slots__` to avoid per-instance `__dict__` (reduces memory but restricts attributes), using `__slots__` + `__slots__` inheritance caveats, `array`/`memoryview` for compact numeric storage, `collections.namedtuple` or `dataclasses` with `__slots__`, and using generators/iterators for streaming. Profile before optimizing.

15. **Q:** How would you profile and optimize Python code for performance?
    **A:** Measure first: use `timeit` for small snippets, `cProfile`/`profile` for CPU profiling, `line_profiler` for per-line hotspots, and `memory_profiler` for memory. Optimize by algorithm improvement, using built-ins, avoiding Python loops (vectorize with NumPy/pandas), caching results (`functools.lru_cache`), offloading to C extensions or `cython`, and using concurrency appropriately (`multiprocessing` for CPU-bound). Re-profile after each change.

# C++ — Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** What is the difference between stack and heap memory in C++?
   **A:** Stack memory is automatically managed; variables are created and destroyed when scope ends. Heap memory is manually allocated with `new`/`delete` (or `malloc`/`free` in C) and persists until explicitly freed. Stack is faster but limited in size; heap is larger but prone to fragmentation and leaks.

---

2. **Q:** Explain RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization).
   **A:** RAII ties the lifetime of resources (memory, file handles, locks) to object lifetime. The resource is acquired in the constructor and released in the destructor, ensuring no leaks even during exceptions. Example: `std::lock_guard` acquires a mutex in constructor and releases it automatically in destructor.

---

3. **Q:** What is the difference between virtual, pure virtual, and abstract classes?
   **A:** A **virtual function** allows runtime polymorphism (overridable). A **pure virtual function** (`=0`) must be overridden in derived classes. A class with at least one pure virtual function is an **abstract class** and cannot be instantiated directly.

---

4. **Q:** What is a vtable and how does dynamic dispatch work in C++?
   **A:** For classes with virtual functions, the compiler generates a hidden table (vtable) mapping virtual functions to their implementations. Each object has a hidden vptr pointing to its class’s vtable. At runtime, calls are dispatched via the vtable pointer, enabling polymorphism.

---

5. **Q:** Difference between shallow copy and deep copy in C++?
   **A:** A shallow copy copies field values only (including raw pointers, leading to shared ownership). A deep copy allocates new memory and duplicates contents, ensuring independence. Rule of Three/Five applies: if you define destructor, copy constructor, or copy assignment, you likely need all three (plus move versions in C++11+).

---

6. **Q:** What are smart pointers? Types in C++11?
   **A:** Smart pointers manage dynamic memory automatically. Types:

   * `std::unique_ptr`: sole ownership, cannot be copied.
   * `std::shared_ptr`: reference-counted shared ownership.
   * `std::weak_ptr`: non-owning reference to a `shared_ptr`.
     They prevent memory leaks and dangling pointers.

---

7. **Q:** Difference between templates and macros?
   **A:** Templates provide type-safe, compile-time polymorphism (functions/classes for multiple types). Macros (`#define`) are preprocessor replacements without type checking. Example: `template <typename T> T add(T a, T b)` vs `#define ADD(a,b) (a+b)` — the latter can cause subtle bugs.

---

8. **Q:** Explain function overloading vs operator overloading.
   **A:** Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameter signatures. Operator overloading redefines operators (`+`, `==`, etc.) for user-defined types, enabling intuitive syntax. Both enhance code readability, but overuse can reduce clarity.

---

9. **Q:** What are lvalues and rvalues? What is move semantics?
   **A:** An **lvalue** has a memory address (e.g., variables), an **rvalue** is a temporary (e.g., `x+1`). Move semantics (`T(T&&)`) allow transferring resources from temporaries instead of copying (introduced in C++11). Example: `std::vector` moves its internal buffer instead of copying it, improving efficiency.

---

10. **Q:** Difference between `struct` and `class` in C++?
    **A:** By default, members of a `struct` are public, while those of a `class` are private. Otherwise, they are functionally identical in C++. In practice, `struct` is often used for simple data structures, and `class` for OOP encapsulation.

---

11. **Q:** What is `inline` keyword and when is it used?
    **A:** `inline` suggests the compiler replace a function call with its body to avoid overhead. It is only a hint; modern compilers decide inlining automatically. Useful in header files for small functions. Overuse can bloat code and harm performance.

---

12. **Q:** Difference between static, extern, and volatile variables?
    **A:**

* `static`: variable retains value across function calls, or internal linkage if at global scope.
* `extern`: declares a variable defined in another translation unit.
* `volatile`: tells compiler that a variable may change outside program control (e.g., hardware registers), so it must always reload the value.

---

13. **Q:** What are key C++11 features interviewers expect you to know?
    **A:** Smart pointers, move semantics (`&&`), `auto` keyword, range-based for loop, lambda expressions, `nullptr`, uniform initialization `{}`, `std::thread`, `std::chrono`, `unordered_map`, variadic templates, and `constexpr`.

---

14. **Q:** Explain multiple inheritance and the diamond problem.
    **A:** Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class. The **diamond problem** arises when two parent classes inherit from the same base, and a child inherits from both parents → ambiguity. Solution: **virtual inheritance** ensures only one shared base instance.

---

15. **Q:** How do you handle memory leaks in C++?
    **A:**

* Prefer smart pointers over raw `new/delete`.
* Use RAII to manage resources.
* Tools like Valgrind or AddressSanitizer help detect leaks.
* Follow Rule of Three/Five.
* Avoid manual memory management unless necessary.

---
# Java — Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** Explain JVM, JRE, and JDK.
   **A:**

   * **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** Executes Java bytecode, providing platform independence.
   * **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** JVM + core libraries, used to run Java applications.
   * **JDK (Java Development Kit):** JRE + compilers and developer tools, used to develop Java applications.

---

2. **Q:** Difference between abstract class and interface in Java?
   **A:**

   * Abstract class: Can have both abstract and concrete methods, constructors, and state (fields).
   * Interface: Prior to Java 8, only abstract methods; since Java 8, can also have default and static methods. No constructors or state.
     Use abstract class when you want partial implementation, interface when you want to define a contract.

---

3. **Q:** What is garbage collection in Java? How does it work?
   **A:** Java GC automatically reclaims memory of unreachable objects. It works by identifying objects with no live references (using reachability analysis), then reclaiming heap space. Generational GC divides heap into Young, Old, and Permanent (or Metaspace in Java 8+) areas. `System.gc()` only suggests GC, not guaranteed.

---

4. **Q:** Explain Java memory model (Heap, Stack, Method area).
   **A:**

   * **Stack:** Stores local variables and method call frames.
   * **Heap:** Stores objects and class instances.
   * **Method Area (Metaspace in Java 8+):** Stores class metadata, static variables, constant pool.
     Each thread has its own stack, but heap is shared.

---

5. **Q:** What are checked vs unchecked exceptions?
   **A:**

   * **Checked exceptions:** Must be declared or handled (e.g., `IOException`, `SQLException`).
   * **Unchecked exceptions:** Subclasses of `RuntimeException`; don’t need explicit handling (e.g., `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`).

---

6. **Q:** Explain multithreading in Java. How are `synchronized` and `volatile` different?
   **A:**

   * Multithreading: Running multiple threads concurrently. Java provides `Thread` class, `Runnable` interface, and `ExecutorService`.
   * `synchronized`: Ensures mutual exclusion and memory visibility for a block/method.
   * `volatile`: Ensures visibility of variable changes across threads but does not provide atomicity.

---

7. **Q:** Explain HashMap internals.
   **A:** HashMap stores key–value pairs using hashing. It uses buckets (array of linked lists or trees since Java 8). Keys are hashed, index = `hash % capacity`. Collisions are handled by chaining (linked list → red-black tree if bucket size > 8). Resizing occurs when load factor (default 0.75) is exceeded.

---

8. **Q:** Difference between `==` and `.equals()` in Java?
   **A:**

   * `==`: Compares object references (memory addresses).
   * `.equals()`: Compares object content; can be overridden. Example:

   ```java
   String a = new String("hello");
   String b = new String("hello");
   a == b        // false
   a.equals(b)   // true
   ```

---

9. **Q:** What is the difference between `final`, `finally`, and `finalize()`?
   **A:**

   * `final`: Keyword for constants, preventing inheritance/overriding.
   * `finally`: Block that executes regardless of exceptions (used in try-catch).
   * `finalize()`: Method called by GC before object destruction (deprecated, unreliable).

---

10. **Q:** Explain method overloading vs overriding.
    **A:**

* Overloading: Same method name, different parameter lists, resolved at **compile time**.
* Overriding: Subclass provides its own implementation of a parent class’s method, resolved at **runtime** (polymorphism).

---

11. **Q:** How does Java achieve platform independence?
    **A:** Java source code → compiled into bytecode → executed by JVM on any platform. JVM abstracts OS/hardware differences. “Write Once, Run Anywhere” is enabled by bytecode portability.

---

12. **Q:** What are functional interfaces in Java 8?
    **A:** A functional interface has exactly one abstract method (SAM). Example: `Runnable`, `Callable`, `Comparator`. Annotated with `@FunctionalInterface`. They enable lambda expressions and method references.

---

13. **Q:** Explain streams and lambdas.
    **A:**

* **Streams:** A pipeline to process data collections (filter, map, reduce) in functional style. Lazy evaluation and parallelism supported.
* **Lambdas:** Anonymous functions introduced in Java 8, e.g., `(x, y) -> x + y`. Useful with functional interfaces.

---

14. **Q:** How does the `String` class achieve immutability?
    **A:** The `String` class stores values in a final char array. Once created, contents cannot be modified. Methods like `substring()` return new objects. Immutability improves security, thread-safety, and enables string pooling.

---

15. **Q:** What is reflection in Java?
    **A:** Reflection allows inspection and modification of classes, methods, and fields at runtime (`java.lang.reflect`). Example: loading classes dynamically, calling methods by name. Used in frameworks (Spring, Hibernate), but can break encapsulation and has performance overhead.

---
# SQL — Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
   **A:**

   * **SQL:** Relational, uses structured tables with rows and columns, supports ACID transactions (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   * **NoSQL:** Non-relational, schema-less or flexible schema, designed for scalability (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
     SQL is best for structured data and complex queries; NoSQL fits unstructured or high-velocity data.

---

2. **Q:** Explain `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN`.
   **A:**

   * **INNER JOIN:** Returns rows where there is a match in both tables.
   * **LEFT JOIN:** Returns all rows from left table + matched rows from right.
   * **RIGHT JOIN:** Returns all rows from right table + matched rows from left.
   * **FULL JOIN:** Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables.

---

3. **Q:** What is normalization? Explain 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF.
   **A:**

   * **1NF:** No repeating groups; each cell holds atomic values.
   * **2NF:** 1NF + no partial dependency on a composite key.
   * **3NF:** 2NF + no transitive dependency (non-key attributes depend only on primary key).
   * **BCNF:** Stronger version of 3NF; each determinant must be a candidate key.
     Purpose: remove redundancy and anomalies.

---

4. **Q:** Difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes?
   **A:**

   * **Clustered index:** Data is physically sorted in the order of the index; only one per table.
   * **Non-clustered index:** Stores pointers to the actual data, can be many per table.
     Clustered is faster for range queries; non-clustered is flexible for multiple search patterns.

---

5. **Q:** Difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses?
   **A:**

   * `WHERE`: Filters rows before grouping/aggregation.
   * `HAVING`: Filters results after grouping/aggregation.
     Example:

   ```sql
   SELECT dept, COUNT(*) 
   FROM employees 
   GROUP BY dept 
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
   ```

---

6. **Q:** Explain ACID properties in DBMS.
   **A:**

   * **Atomicity:** Transactions are all-or-nothing.
   * **Consistency:** Transactions take DB from one valid state to another.
   * **Isolation:** Concurrent transactions don’t interfere with each other.
   * **Durability:** Once committed, data persists even after failures.

---

7. **Q:** Difference between stored procedure and function?
   **A:**

   * **Stored Procedure:** Can perform multiple operations (insert, update), return zero/multiple values, allow transactions.
   * **Function:** Must return a value, can be used in SELECT queries, cannot perform transactions.

---

8. **Q:** Difference between `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DROP`?
   **A:**

   * **DELETE:** Removes rows; can have `WHERE`; logged; slower.
   * **TRUNCATE:** Removes all rows; no `WHERE`; faster; resets identity.
   * **DROP:** Deletes entire table structure + data.

---

9. **Q:** What are transactions and savepoints?
   **A:**

   * **Transaction:** A unit of work executed as a whole (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK).
   * **Savepoint:** A marker inside a transaction to roll back partially instead of the whole transaction.

---

10. **Q:** Difference between primary key and foreign key?
    **A:**

    * **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies each row; cannot be NULL.
    * **Foreign Key:** A reference to a primary key in another table; enforces referential integrity.

---

11. **Q:** Explain window functions with examples.
    **A:** Window functions operate on a set of rows relative to the current row. Examples:

    * `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assigns unique row number.
    * `RANK()`: Ranks rows, gaps for ties.
    * `DENSE_RANK()`: Ranks without gaps.

    ```sql
    SELECT name, salary, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) 
    FROM employees;
    ```

---

12. **Q:** How do you optimize SQL queries?
    **A:**

    * Use indexes wisely (on frequently queried columns).
    * Avoid `SELECT *`, fetch only required columns.
    * Use proper joins instead of subqueries.
    * Partition large tables.
    * Analyze execution plan (`EXPLAIN`).
    * Avoid functions on indexed columns in `WHERE`.

---

13. **Q:** Difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`?
    **A:**

    * **UNION:** Combines results and removes duplicates (extra sort step).
    * **UNION ALL:** Combines results, keeps duplicates, faster.

---

14. **Q:** Explain deadlocks in SQL.
    **A:** A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions hold locks and wait for each other, causing a cycle. Example: T1 locks Table A and waits for Table B, while T2 locks Table B and waits for Table A. DBMS resolves by killing one transaction. Prevent by consistent locking order, shorter transactions, and using lower isolation levels when safe.

---

15. **Q:** What is indexing and when can it degrade performance?
    **A:** Indexing speeds up queries by reducing search space (like a book index). However, too many indexes degrade performance because every `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` must also update indexes. Choose indexes carefully based on query patterns.

## 15. Fine-tuning BERT

**Q:** How do you fine-tune BERT for text classification?

**Python Example (HuggingFace):**

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
from torch.optim import AdamW
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=2)

inputs = tokenizer(["I love NLP", "I hate ML"], padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
labels = torch.tensor([1, 0])

outputs = model(**inputs, labels=labels)
loss = outputs.loss
logits = outputs.logits
```
